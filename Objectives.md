<h1>
What is the purpose of this project?
</h1>
<p>
I want to showcase my expertise in MERN stack, cyber security awareness and methodical approach to solving problems. It is effectively an example/dummy project to present all those skills neatly in one project.

<h2>
Development strategy
</h2>
<p>
Since I am really low on time, I want to have fully built sections of this project up and ready in a presentable form ASAP. That means HTML, CSS, and tech need to be spotless all at once.
<br>
Alternatively, I could create a suitable HTML and CSS structure before hand and then utilize the styles later. This is problematic because its an initial investment, and I dont have time.
<br>
<strong>
Action plan:
</strong>
<ol>
<li>Make HTML document</li>
<li>Make CSS style</li>
<li>Implement JS</li>
<li>Merge with main project</li>
</ol>
